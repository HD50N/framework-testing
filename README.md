# Framework Testing Repository

This repository contains example applications built with various modern web frameworks, all implementing the same design and functionality for easy comparison.

## Frameworks Included

### âœ… Completed
- **React + Vite** - `/react-vite/`
- **Next.js** - `/nextjs/` 
- **Angular** - `/angular-app/`
- **Svelte** - `/svelte/`
- **Remix** - `/remix/`
- **Vue.js** - `/vue/`

### ðŸš§ Planned
- **Nuxt.js** - `/nuxtjs/`
- **Basic HTML** - `/basic-html/`

## Features Implemented

Each framework implementation includes:

- **Home Page** - Welcome page with feature cards
- **About Page** - Information about the application and technologies
- **Contact Page** - Contact form and information
- **Navigation** - Responsive navigation with active state highlighting
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety (where applicable)
- **Tailwind CSS** - Modern, responsive styling
- **Routing** - Client-side navigation between pages

## Design Consistency

All applications follow the same design system:
- **Home**: Blue gradient background with feature showcase
- **About**: Green gradient background with mission and tech stack
- **Contact**: Purple gradient background with contact form
- **Navigation**: Clean white header with blue accent colors

## Getting Started

Each framework directory contains its own `package.json` and can be run independently:

```bash
# Example: Running the React app
cd react-vite
npm install
npm run dev

# Example: Running the Vue app  
cd vue
npm install
npm run dev

# Example: Running the Next.js app
cd nextjs
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Technologies Used

- **Build Tools**: Vite, Next.js, Angular CLI, SvelteKit, Remix
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4+
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Routing**: Framework-specific routing solutions
- **Package Management**: npm

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practical comparison of different web frameworks, showing how the same application can be implemented across various technologies. It's useful for:

- Learning different framework approaches
- Comparing development experiences
- Understanding framework-specific patterns
- Teaching and demonstration purposes

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new framework implementations
- Improving existing implementations
- Enhancing the shared design system
- Adding new features across all frameworks
